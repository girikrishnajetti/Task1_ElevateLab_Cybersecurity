Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports 
Objective: Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand 
network exposure. 
Tools: Nmap, Wireshark. 
Command used: sudo nmap -sS -T4 --open 192.XXX.XXX.0/24






IP Address              Port  Service               State            Vendor 
192.XXX.X.XXX            72   msrpc               open            Microsoft Windows RPC



Summary: 
• Port 72 (RPC) is open. 






❖ Wireshark Packet Capture & Analysis 
Capture Details: 
• Interface used: wifi
• Capture filter: net 192.XXX.X.XXX/24 
• Tool: Wireshark  
• Purpose: To observe Nmap SYN scan traffic and verify open ports. 
Observations: 
1) SYN Scan Traffic: 
Using the filter: tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
























2) Using the filter: tcp

















3) The filter: dns 

















Conclusion:  
Wireshark packet capture validates the Nmap scan: 
• Only  active service was detected:  (port 72) on 192.XXX.X.XXX
• All other hosts returned TCP resets, indicating closed ports. 
• Traffic analysis confirms the network is low exposure with minimal attack surface.
